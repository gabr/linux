There is a similar question on how to install JRE 7.

Install the JDK
Download he 32bit or 64bit Linux "compressed binary file" - it has a ".tar.gz" file extension i.e. "[java-version]-i586.tar.gz" for 32bit and "[java-version]-x64.tar.gz" for 64bit
Uncompress it

tar -xvf jdk-7u2-linux-i586.tar.gz (32bit)

tar -xvf jdk-7u2-linux-x64.tar.gz (64bit)

JDK 7 package is extracted into ./jdk1.7.0_02 directory. - Now move the JDK 7 directory to /usr/lib

sudo mv ./jdk1.7.0_02 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0

Now run
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javac" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javaws" 1
Run
sudo update-alternatives --config java
You will see output similar one below - choose the number of jdk1.7.0 - for example 3 in this list:

$sudo update-alternatives --config java
There are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

Selection Path Priority Status
————————————————————
* 0 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java 1061 auto mode
1 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java 1061 manual mode
2 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java 63 manual mode
3 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/bin/java 3 manual mode

Press enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 3
update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/bin/java to provide /usr/bin/java (java) in manual mode.
Check the version of you new JDK 7 installation:

java -version

java version “1.7.0”
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0-b147)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 21.0-b17, mixed mode) 
Repeat the above for:

sudo update-alternatives --config javac
sudo update-alternatives --config javaws
Enable mozilla firefox plugin:

32 bit:
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/

64 bit:
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/
Depending on your configuration, you might need to update the apparmor profile for firefox (or other browsers) in /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/ubuntu-browsers.d/java

# Replace the two lines:
#  /usr/lib/jvm/java-*-sun-1.*/jre/bin/java{,_vm} cx -> browser_java,
#  /usr/lib/jvm/java-*-sun-1.*/jre/lib/*/libnp*.so cx -> browser_java,
# with those (or adapt to your new jdk folder name)
/usr/lib/jvm/jdk*/jre/bin/java{,_vm} cx -> browser_java,
/usr/lib/jvm/jdk*/jre/lib/*/libnp*.so cx -> browser_java,
Then restart apparmor:

sudo /etc/init.d/apparmor restart
Confirm that the JRE has been successful by using the official oracle website.

For Java 6:

How do I install Oracle JDK 6?
If you're on a fresh installation of Ubuntu with no previous Java installations, this script automates the process outlined above if you don't want to type all that into a console. Remember, you still need to download Java from Oracle's website -- Oracle's links are not wget friendly.

Before using this make sure that this script is in the same directory as the .tar.gz file extension that you downloaded and there are no files that start with jdk-7 in the same folder -- if there are, please move them out of the folder temporarily. Remember to make the script executable, either by doing chmod +x <script's directory> or right clicking the document, pressing properties, going to the Permissions tab, and checking "Allow executing file as a program."

#!/bin/sh

tar -xvf jdk-7*
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm
sudo mv ./jdk1.7* /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javac" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javaws" 1
sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/java
sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/javac
sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/javaws
If you want to install the plugin for Firefox then add this to the end of the script

mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/
sudo /etc/init.d/apparmor restart
Confirm if Java has been properly installed.

java -version
Confirm that the JRE Mozilla plugin has been successful by using the official oracle website.

This is a real life saver, i sucessfully got sun java working on Firefox. But on Chrome, it just crashes, all the pages i try to see with sun java, they crash like this one: javatester.org. Is it possible to have Sun Java JDK plugin working in Google Chrome? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 64bits – LnxSlck Apr 29 at 18:27
It should be the same - perhaps remove the icedtea plugin? Look at the Oracle JDK 6 answer I linked to... – fossfreedom♦ Apr 29 at 19:12
There are about 47 executable files in $JAVA_HOME/bin and $JAVA_HOME/jre/bin which cries for an script to update all the entries in the alternatives system. See the /usr/lib/jvm/.java*.jinfo files. Here is a blogpost which adresses the jinfo-file issue. – user unknown Jun 5 at 23:30

The folder I downloaded was 'jdk.1.7.0' -- not 'jdk1.7.0' like is mentioned in this answer. Otherwise worked great for me, thanks. – Zachary Schuessler Jul 23 at 13:53

If you're on a new installation of Ubuntu, remember to do sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/java sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/javac sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/javaws – umop aplsdn Aug 26 at 19:07
