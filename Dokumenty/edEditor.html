<h2 class="unnumbered">The GNU ed line editor</h2>

<p>This manual is for GNU ed (version 1.12, 4 July 2015).

   </p><pre class="sp">
</pre>
GNU ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display,
modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via
shell scripts. A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in
the current directory and cannot execute shell commands. Ed is the
"standard" text editor in the sense that it is the original editor for
Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes, however, it is
superseded by full-screen editors such as GNU Emacs or GNU Moe.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p><samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create,
display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files. <samp><span class="command">red</span></samp> is a
restricted <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>: it can only edit files in the current directory
and cannot execute shell commands.

   </p><p>If invoked with a <var>file</var> argument, then a copy of <var>file</var> is read
into the editor's buffer. Changes are made to this copy and not directly
to <var>file</var> itself. Upon quitting <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>, any changes not
explicitly saved with a '<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>' command are lost.

   </p><p>Editing is done in two distinct modes: <dfn>command</dfn> and <dfn>input</dfn>. 
When first invoked, <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> is in command mode. In this mode
commands are read from the standard input and executed to manipulate the
contents of the editor buffer. A typical command might look like:

</p><pre class="example">     ,s/<var>old</var>/<var>new</var>/g
</pre>
   <p>which replaces all occurences of the string <var>old</var> with <var>new</var>.

   </p><p>When an input command, such as '<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' (append), '<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>' (insert) or
'<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>' (change), is given, <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> enters input mode. This is the
primary means of adding text to a file. In this mode, no commands are
available; instead, the standard input is written directly to the editor
buffer. A <dfn>line</dfn> consists of the text up to and including a
&lt;newline&gt; character. Input mode is terminated by entering a single
period ('<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>') on a line.

   </p><p>All <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> commands operate on whole lines or ranges of lines;
e.g., the '<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>' command deletes lines; the '<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>' command moves
lines, and so on. It is possible to modify only a portion of a line by
means of replacement, as in the example above. However even here, the
'<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' command is applied to whole lines at a time.

   </p><p>In general, <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> commands consist of zero or more line
addresses, followed by a single character command and possibly
additional parameters; i.e., commands have the structure:

</p><pre class="example">     [<var>address</var>[,<var>address</var>]]<var>command</var>[<var>parameters</var>]
</pre>
   <p>The <var>address</var>es indicate the line or range of lines to be affected
by the command. If fewer addresses are given than the command accepts,
then default addresses are supplied.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Introduction to line editing</h2>

<p><samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> was created, along with the Unix operating system, by Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. It is the refinement of its more complex,
programmable predecessor, <cite>QED</cite>, to which Thompson and Ritchie had
already added pattern matching capabilities (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ed/manual/ed_manual.html#Regular-expressions">Regular expressions</a>).

   </p><p>For the purposes of this tutorial, a working knowledge of the Unix shell
<samp><span class="command">sh</span></samp> and the Unix file system is recommended, since <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>
is designed to interact closely with them. 
(See the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/">bash manual</a>
for details about bash).

   </p><p>The principal difference between line editors and display editors is
that display editors provide instant feedback to user commands, whereas
line editors require sometimes lengthy input before any effects are
seen. The advantage of instant feedback, of course, is that if a mistake
is made, it can be corrected immediately, before more damage is done. 
Editing in <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> requires more strategy and forethought; but if
you are up to the task, it can be quite efficient.

   </p><p>Much of the <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> command syntax is shared with other Unix
utilities.

   </p><p>As with the shell, &lt;RETURN&gt; (the carriage-return key) enters a line
of input. So when we speak of "entering" a command or some text in
<samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>, &lt;RETURN&gt; is implied at the end of each line. Prior to
typing &lt;RETURN&gt;, corrections to the line may be made by typing
either &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to erase characters backwards, or &lt;CONTROL&gt;-u
(i.e., hold the CONTROL key and type u) to erase the whole line.

   </p><p>When <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> first opens, it expects to be told what to do but
doesn't prompt us like the shell. So let's begin by telling <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>
to do so with the &lt;P&gt; (<dfn>prompt</dfn>) command:

</p><pre class="example">     $ ed
     P
     *
</pre>
   <p>By default, <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> uses asterisk ('<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>') as command prompt to
avoid confusion with the shell command prompt ('<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>').

   </p><p>We can run Unix shell (<samp><span class="command">sh</span></samp>) commands from inside <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>
by prefixing them with &lt;!&gt; (exclamation mark, aka "bang"). For
example:

</p><pre class="example">     *!date
     Mon Jun 26 10:08:41 PDT 2006
     !
     *!for s in hello world; do echo $s; done
     hello
     world
     !
     *
</pre>
   <p>So far, this is no different from running commands in the Unix shell. 
But let's say we want to edit the output of a command, or save it to a
file. First we must capture the command output to a temporary location
called a <dfn>buffer</dfn> where <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> can access it. This is done
with <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>'s &lt;r&gt; command (mnemonic: <dfn>read</dfn>):

</p><pre class="example">     *r !cal -m
     137
     *
</pre>
   <p>Here <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> is telling us that it has just read 137 characters
into the editor buffer - i.e., the output of the <samp><span class="command">cal</span></samp> command,
which prints a simple ASCII calendar. To display the buffer contents we
issue the &lt;p&gt; (<dfn>print</dfn>) command (not to be confused with the
prompt command, which is uppercase!). To indicate the range of lines in
the buffer that should be printed, we prefix the command with &lt;,&gt;
(comma) which is shorthand for "the whole buffer":

</p><pre class="example">     *,p
           June 2006
     Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
               1  2  3  4
      5  6  7  8  9 10 11
     12 13 14 15 16 17 18
     19 20 21 22 23 24 25
     26 27 28 29 30
     
     *
</pre>
   <p>Now let's write the buffer contents to a file named <code>junk</code> with the
&lt;w&gt; (<dfn>write</dfn>) command:

</p><pre class="example">     *w junk
     137
     *
</pre>
   <p>Need we say? It's good practice to frequently write the buffer contents,
since unwritten changes to the buffer will be lost when we exit
<samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>.

   </p><p>The sample sessions below illustrate some basic concepts of line editing
with <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>. We begin by creating a file, '<samp><span class="samp">sonnet</span></samp>', with some
help from Shakespeare. As with the shell, all input to <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> must
be followed by a &lt;newline&gt; character. Commands beginning with
'<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' are taken as comments and ignored. Input mode lines that begin
with '<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' are just more input.

</p><pre class="example">     $ ed
     # The 'a' command is for appending text to the editor buffer.
     a
     No more be grieved at that which thou hast done.
     Roses have thorns, and filvers foutians mud.
     Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
     And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
     .
     # Entering a single period on a line returns <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> to command mode.
     # Now write the buffer to the file '<samp><span class="samp">sonnet</span></samp>' and quit:
     w sonnet
     183
     # <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> reports the number of characters written.
     q
     $ ls -l
     total 2
     -rw-rw-r--    1 alm           183 Nov 10 01:16 sonnet
     $
</pre>
   <p>In the next example, some typos are corrected in the file '<samp><span class="samp">sonnet</span></samp>'.

</p><pre class="example">     $ ed sonnet
     183
     # Begin by printing the buffer to the terminal with the '<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' command.
     # The ',' means "all lines".
     ,p
     No more be grieved at that which thou hast done.
     Roses have thorns, and filvers foutians mud.
     Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
     And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
     # Select line 2 for editing.
     2
     Roses have thorns, and filvers foutians mud.
     # Use the substitute command, '<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>', to replace 'filvers' with 'silver',
     # and print the result.
     s/filvers/silver/p
     Roses have thorns, and silver foutians mud.
     # And correct the spelling of 'fountains'.
     s/utia/untai/p
     Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud.
     w sonnet
     183
     q
     $
</pre>
   <p>Since <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> is line-oriented, we have to tell it which line, or
range of lines we want to edit. In the above example, we do this by
specifying the line's number, or sequence in the buffer. Alternatively,
we could have specified a unique string in the line, e.g.,
'<samp><span class="samp">/filvers/</span></samp>', where the '<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>'s delimit the string in question. 
Subsequent commands affect only the selected line, a.k.a. the
<dfn>current</dfn> line. Portions of that line are then replaced with the
substitute command, whose syntax is '<samp><span class="samp">s/</span><var>old</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>new</var><span class="samp">/</span></samp>'.

   </p><p>Although <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> accepts only one command per line, the print
command '<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' is an exception, and may be appended to the end of most
commands.

   </p><p>In the next example, a title is added to our sonnet.

</p><pre class="example">     $ ed sonnet
     183
     a
      Sonnet #50
     .
     ,p
     No more be grieved at that which thou hast done.
     Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud.
     Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
     And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
      Sonnet #50
     # The title got appended to the end; we should have used '0a'
     # to append "before the first line".
     # Move the title to its proper place.
     5m0p
      Sonnet #50
     # The title is now the first line, and the current line has been
     # set to this line as well.
     ,p
      Sonnet #50
     No more be grieved at that which thou hast done.
     Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud.
     Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
     And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
     wq sonnet
     195
     $
</pre>
   <p>When <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> opens a file, the current line is initially set to the
last line of that file. Similarly, the move command '<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>' sets the
current line to the last line moved.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Invoking ed</h2>

<p>The format for running <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> is:

</p><pre class="example">     ed [<var>options</var>] [<var>file</var>]
     red [<var>options</var>] [<var>file</var>]
</pre>
   <p><var>file</var> specifies the name of a file to read. If <var>file</var> is
prefixed with a bang (!), then it is interpreted as a shell command. In
this case, what is read is the standard output of <var>file</var> executed
via <samp><span class="command">sh (1)</span></samp>. To read a file whose name begins with a bang,
prefix the name with a backslash (<kbd>\</kbd>). The default filename is set
to <var>file</var> only if it is not prefixed with a bang.

   </p><p><samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> supports the following options:

     </p><dl>
<dt><code>-h</code></dt><dt><code>--help</code></dt><dd>Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-V</code></dt><dt><code>--version</code></dt><dd>Print the version number of <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> on the standard output and exit.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-G</code></dt><dt><code>--traditional</code></dt><dd>Forces backwards compatibility. This affects the behavior of the
<samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> commands '<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">V</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>',
'<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>' and '<samp><span class="samp">!!</span></samp>'. If the default behavior of these commands does
not seem familiar, then try invoking <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> with this switch.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-l</code></dt><dt><code>--loose-exit-status</code></dt><dd>Do not exit with bad status if a command happens to "fail" (for example
if a substitution command finds nothing to replace). This can be useful
when <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> is invoked as the editor for crontab.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-p </code><var>string</var></dt><dt><code>--prompt=</code><var>string</var></dt><dd>Specifies a command prompt. This may be toggled on and off with the
'<samp><span class="samp">P</span></samp>' command.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-r</code></dt><dt><code>--restricted</code></dt><dd>Run in restricted mode. This mode disables editing of files out of the
current directory and execution of shell commands.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-s</code></dt><dt><code>--quiet</code></dt><dt><code>--silent</code></dt><dd>Suppresses diagnostics. This should be used if <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>'s standard
input is from a script.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-v</code></dt><dt><code>--verbose</code></dt><dd>Verbose mode. This may be toggled on and off with the '<samp><span class="samp">H</span></samp>' command.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Line addressing</h2>

<p>An address represents the number of a line in the buffer. <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>
maintains a <dfn>current address</dfn> which is typically supplied to
commands as the default address when none is specified. When a file is
first read, the current address is set to the last line of the file. In
general, the current address is set to the last line affected by a
command.

   </p><p>One exception to the rule that addresses represent line numbers is the
address '<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' (zero). This means "before the first line", and is
valid wherever it makes sense.

   </p><p>An address range is two addresses separated either by a comma ('<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>')
or a semicolon ('<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>'). The value of the first address in a range
cannot exceed the value of the second. If only one address is given in a
range, then the second address is set to the given address. If an
<var>n</var>-tuple of addresses is given where <var>n</var> &gt; 2, then the
corresponding range is determined by the last two addresses in the
<var>n</var>-tuple. If only one address is expected, then the last address is
used.

   </p><p>In a semicolon-delimited range, the current address ('<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>') is set to
the first address before the second address is calculated. This feature
can be used to set the starting line for searches.

   </p><p>A line address is constructed as follows:

     </p><dl>
<dt><code>.</code></dt><dd>The current line (address) in the buffer.

     <br></dd><dt><code>$</code></dt><dd>The last line in the buffer.

     <br></dd><dt><var>n</var></dt><dd>The <var>n</var>th line in the buffer, where <var>n</var> is a number in the range
'<samp><span class="samp">0,$</span></samp>'.

     <br></dd><dt><code>+</code><var>n</var></dt><dd>The <var>n</var>th next line, where <var>n</var> is a non-negative number.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-</code><var>n</var></dt><dd>The <var>n</var>th previous line, where <var>n</var> is a non-negative number.

     <br></dd><dt><code>+</code></dt><dd>The next line. This is equivalent to '<samp><span class="samp">+1</span></samp>' and may be repeated with
cumulative effect.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-</code></dt><dd>The previous line. This is equivalent to '<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>' and may be repeated
with cumulative effect.

     <br></dd><dt><code>,</code></dt><dd>The first through last lines in the buffer. This is equivalent to the
address range '<samp><span class="samp">1,$</span></samp>'.

     <br></dd><dt><code>;</code></dt><dd>The current through last lines in the buffer. This is equivalent to the
address range '<samp><span class="samp">.,$</span></samp>'.

     <br></dd><dt><code>/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code></dt><dd>The next line containing the regular expression <var>re</var>. The search
wraps to the beginning of the buffer and continues down to the current
line, if necessary. '<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>' repeats the last search.

     <br></dd><dt><code>?</code><var>re</var><code>?</code></dt><dd>The previous line containing the regular expression <var>re</var>. The search

a '<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>' (mark) command, where '<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' is a lower case letter from
the portable character set.

   <p>Addresses can be followed by one or more address offsets, optionally
separated by whitespace. Offsets are constructed as follows:

     </p><ul>
<li>A number adds the indicated number of lines to the address.

     </li><li>'<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' or '<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' followed by a number adds or subtracts the
indicated number of lines to or from the address.

     </li><li>'<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' or '<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' not followed by a number adds or subtracts 1 to or
from the address.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Regular expressions</h2>

<p>Regular expressions are patterns used in selecting text. For example,
the <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> command

</p><pre class="example">     g/<var>string</var>/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">prints all lines containing <var>string</var>. Regular expressions are also
used by the '<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' command for selecting old text to be replaced with
new text.

   </p><p>In addition to a specifying string literals, regular expressions can
represent classes of strings. Strings thus represented are said to be
matched by the corresponding regular expression. If it is possible for a
regular expression to match several strings in a line, then the
left-most longest match is the one selected.

   </p><p>The following symbols are used in constructing regular expressions:

     </p><dl>
<dt><var>c</var></dt><dd>Any character <var>c</var> not listed below, including '<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>',
'<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>' and '<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>', matches itself.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\</code><var>c</var></dt><dd>Any backslash-escaped character <var>c</var>, other than '<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>',
'<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>',
'<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' and '<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>', matches itself.

     <br></dd><dt><code>.</code></dt><dd>Matches any single character.

     <br></dd><dt><code>[</code><var>char-class</var><code>]</code></dt><dd>Matches any single character in <var>char-class</var>. To include a '<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'
in <var>char-class</var>, it must be the first character. A range of
characters may be specified by separating the end characters of the
range with a '<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>', e.g., '<samp><span class="samp">a-z</span></samp>' specifies the lower case
characters. The following literal expressions can also be used in
<var>char-class</var> to specify sets of characters:

     <pre class="example">          [:alnum:] [:cntrl:] [:lower:] [:space:]
          [:alpha:] [:digit:] [:print:] [:upper:]
          [:blank:] [:graph:] [:punct:] [:xdigit:]
</pre>
     <p>If '<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' appears as the first or last character of <var>char-class</var>,
then it matches itself. All other characters in <var>char-class</var> match
themselves.

     </p><p>Patterns in
<var>char-class</var>
of the form:
     </p><pre class="example">          [.<var>col-elm</var>.]
          [=<var>col-elm</var>=]
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">where <var>col-elm</var> is a <dfn>collating element</dfn> are interpreted
according to <code>locale (5)</code>. See
<code>regex (3)</code> for an explanation of these constructs.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>[^</code><var>char-class</var><code>]</code></dt><dd>Matches any single character, other than newline, not in
<var>char-class</var>.  <var>char-class</var> is defined as above.

     <br></dd><dt><code>^</code></dt><dd>If '<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' is the first character of a regular expression, then it
anchors the regular expression to the beginning of a line. Otherwise,
it matches itself.

     <br></dd><dt><code>$</code></dt><dd>If '<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' is the last character of a regular expression, it anchors
the regular expression to the end of a line. Otherwise, it matches
itself.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\(</code><var>re</var><code>\)</code></dt><dd>Defines a (possibly null) subexpression <var>re</var>. Subexpressions may be
nested. A subsequent backreference of the form '<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>n</var></samp>', where
<var>n</var> is a number in the range [1,9], expands to the text matched by
the <var>n</var>th subexpression. For example, the regular expression
'<samp><span class="samp">\(a.c\)\1</span></samp>' matches the string '<samp><span class="samp">abcabc</span></samp>', but not
'<samp><span class="samp">abcadc</span></samp>'. Subexpressions are ordered relative to their left
delimiter.

     <br></dd><dt><code>*</code></dt><dd>Matches the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately preceding it zero or more times. If '<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' is the first
character of a regular expression or subexpression, then it matches
itself. The '<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' operator sometimes yields unexpected results. For
example, the regular expression '<samp><span class="samp">b*</span></samp>' matches the beginning of the
string '<samp><span class="samp">abbb</span></samp>', as opposed to the substring '<samp><span class="samp">bbb</span></samp>', since a null
match is the only left-most match.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\{</code><var>n</var><code>,</code><var>m</var><code>\}</code></dt><dt><code>\{</code><var>n</var><code>,\}</code></dt><dt><code>\{</code><var>n</var><code>\}</code></dt><dd>Matches the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately preceding it at least <var>n</var> and at most <var>m</var> times. If
<var>m</var> is omitted, then it matches at least <var>n</var> times. If the comma
is also omitted, then it matches exactly <var>n</var> times. If any of these
forms occurs first in a regular expression or subexpression, then it is
interpreted literally (i.e., the regular expression '<samp><span class="samp">\{2\}</span></samp>'
matches the string '<samp><span class="samp">{2}</span></samp>', and so on).

     <br></dd><dt><code>\&lt;</code></dt><dt><code>\&gt;</code></dt><dd>Anchors the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately following it to the beginning (in the case of '<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;</span></samp>') or
ending (in the case of '<samp><span class="samp">\&gt;</span></samp>') of a <dfn>word</dfn>, i.e., in ASCII, a
maximal string of alphanumeric characters, including the underscore (_).

   </dd></dl>

   <p>The following extended operators are preceded by a backslash '<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' to
distinguish them from traditional <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> syntax.

     </p><dl>
<dt><code>\`</code></dt><dt><code>\'</code></dt><dd>Unconditionally matches the beginning '<samp><span class="samp">\`</span></samp>' or ending '<samp><span class="samp">\'</span></samp>' of a line.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\?</code></dt><dd>Optionally matches the single character regular expression or
subexpression immediately preceding it. For example, the regular
expression '<samp><span class="samp">a[bd]\?c</span></samp>' matches the strings '<samp><span class="samp">abc</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">adc</span></samp>'
and '<samp><span class="samp">ac</span></samp>'. If '<samp><span class="samp">\?</span></samp>' occurs at the beginning of a regular
expressions or subexpression, then it matches a literal '<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>'.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\+</code></dt><dd>Matches the single character regular expression or subexpression
immediately preceding it one or more times. So the regular expression
'<samp><span class="samp">a+</span></samp>' is shorthand for '<samp><span class="samp">aa*</span></samp>'. If '<samp><span class="samp">\+</span></samp>' occurs at the
beginning of a regular expression or subexpression, then it matches a
literal '<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\b</code></dt><dd>Matches the beginning or ending (null string) of a word. Thus the
regular expression '<samp><span class="samp">\bhello\b</span></samp>' is equivalent to '<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;hello\&gt;</span></samp>'. 
However, '<samp><span class="samp">\b\b</span></samp>' is a valid regular expression whereas '<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;\&gt;</span></samp>'
is not.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\B</code></dt><dd>Matches (a null string) inside a word.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\w</code></dt><dd>Matches any character in a word.

     <br></dd><dt><code>\W</code></dt><dd>Matches any character not in a word.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Commands</h2>

<p>All <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> commands are single characters, though some require
additonal parameters. If a command's parameters extend over several
lines, then each line except for the last must be terminated with a
backslash ('<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>').

   </p><p>In general, at most one command is allowed per line. However, most
commands accept a print suffix, which is any of '<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' (print),
'<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>' (list), or '<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>' (enumerate), to print the last line
affected by the command.

   </p><p>An interrupt (typically &lt;Control-C&gt;) has the effect of aborting the
current command and returning the editor to command mode.

   </p><p><samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> recognizes the following commands. The commands are shown
together with the default address or address range supplied if none is
specified (in parenthesis).

     </p><dl>
<dt><code>(.)a</code></dt><dd>Appends text to the buffer after the addressed line, which may be the
address '<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' (zero). Text is entered in input mode. The current
address is set to last line entered.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)c</code></dt><dd>Changes lines in the buffer. The addressed lines are deleted from the
buffer, and text is appended in their place. Text is entered in input
mode. The current address is set to last line entered.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)d</code></dt><dd>Deletes the addressed lines from the buffer. If there is a line after
the deleted range, then the current address is set to this line. 
Otherwise the current address is set to the line before the deleted
range.

     <br></dd><dt><code>e </code><var>file</var></dt><dd>Edits <var>file</var>, and sets the default filename. If <var>file</var> is not
specified, then the default filename is used. Any lines in the buffer
are deleted before the new file is read. The current address is set to
the last line read.

     <br></dd><dt><code>e !</code><var>command</var></dt><dd>Edits the standard output of '<samp><span class="samp">!</span><var>command</var></samp>', (see the '<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>'
command below). The default filename is unchanged. Any lines in the
buffer are deleted before the output of <var>command</var> is read. The
current address is set to the last line read.

     <br></dd><dt><code>E </code><var>file</var></dt><dd>Edits <var>file</var> unconditionally. This is similar to the '<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>'
command, except that unwritten changes are discarded without warning. 
The current address is set to the last line read.

     <br></dd><dt><code>f </code><var>file</var></dt><dd>Sets the default filename to <var>file</var>. If <var>file</var> is not specified,
then the default unescaped filename is printed.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(1,$)g/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code><var>command-list</var></dt><dd>Global command. Applies <var>command-list</var> to each of the addressed
lines matching a regular expression <var>re</var>. The current address is set
to the line currently matched before <var>command-list</var> is executed. At
the end of the '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' command, the current address is set to the last
line affected by <var>command-list</var>.

     <p>At least the first command of <var>command-list</var> must appear on the same
line as the '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' command. All lines of a multi-line
<var>command-list</var> except the last line must be terminated with a
backslash ('<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>'). Any commands are allowed, except for '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>',
'<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>', and '<samp><span class="samp">V</span></samp>'. By default, a newline alone in
<var>command-list</var> is equivalent to a '<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' command. If <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>
is invoked with the command-line option '<samp><span class="samp">-G</span></samp>', then a newline in
<var>command-list</var> is equivalent to a '<samp><span class="samp">.+1p</span></samp>' command.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>(1,$)G/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code></dt><dd>Interactive global command. Interactively edits the addressed lines
matching a regular expression <var>re</var>. For each matching line, the line
is printed, the current address is set, and the user is prompted to
enter a <var>command-list</var>. At the end of the '<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>' command, the
current address is set to the last line affected by (the last)
<var>command-list</var>.

     <p>The format of <var>command-list</var> is the same as that of the '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>'
command. A newline alone acts as a null command list. A single '<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>'
repeats the last non-null command list.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>h</code></dt><dd>Prints an explanation of the last error.

     <br></dd><dt><code>H</code></dt><dd>Toggles the printing of error explanations. By default, explanations are
not printed. It is recommended that ed scripts begin with this command
to aid in debugging.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.)i</code></dt><dd>Inserts text in the buffer before the current line. The address '<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>'
(zero) is valid for this command; it is equivalent to address '<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'. 
Text is entered in input mode. The current address is set to the last
line entered.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.+1)j</code></dt><dd>Joins the addressed lines. The addressed lines are deleted from the
buffer and replaced by a single line containing their joined text. The
current address is set to the resultant line.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.)kx</code></dt><dd>Marks a line with a lower case letter '<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>'. The line can then be
addressed as '<samp><span class="samp">'x</span></samp>' (i.e., a single quote followed by '<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>') in
subsequent commands. The mark is not cleared until the line is deleted
or otherwise modified.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)l</code></dt><dd>Prints the addressed lines unambiguously. The end of each line is marked
with a '<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>', and every '<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' character within the text is printed
with a preceding backslash. The current address is set to the last line
printed.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)m(.)</code></dt><dd>Moves lines in the buffer. The addressed lines are moved to after the
right-hand destination address, which may be the address '<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>'
(zero). The current address is set to the new address of the last line
moved.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)n</code></dt><dd>Prints the addressed lines, preceding each line by its line number and a
&lt;tab&gt;. The current address is set to the last line printed.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)p</code></dt><dd>Prints the addressed lines. The current address is set to the last line
printed.

     <br></dd><dt><code>P</code></dt><dd>Toggles the command prompt on and off. Unless a prompt is specified with
command-line option '<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>', the command prompt is by default turned
off.

     <br></dd><dt><code>q</code></dt><dd>Quits <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>.

     <br></dd><dt><code>Q</code></dt><dd>Quits <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> unconditionally. This is similar to the <code>q</code>
command, except that unwritten changes are discarded without warning.

     <br></dd><dt><code>($)r </code><var>file</var></dt><dd>Reads <var>file</var> to after the addressed line. If <var>file</var> is not
specified, then the default filename is used. If there is no default
filename prior to the command, then the default filename is set to
<var>file</var>. Otherwise, the default filename is unchanged. The current
address is set to the last line read.

     <br></dd><dt><code>($)r !</code><var>command</var></dt><dd>Reads to after the addressed line the standard output of
'<samp><span class="samp">!command</span></samp>', (see the '<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' command below). The default filename
is unchanged. The current address is set to the last line read.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)s/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code><var>replacement</var><code>/</code></dt><dt><code>(.,.)s/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code><var>replacement</var><code>/g</code></dt><dt><code>(.,.)s/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code><var>replacement</var><code>/</code><var>n</var></dt><dd>Replaces text in the addressed lines matching a regular expression
<var>re</var> with <var>replacement</var>. By default, only the first match in
each line is replaced. If the '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' (global) suffix is given, then
every match is replaced. The <var>n</var> suffix, where <var>n</var> is a postive
number, causes only the <var>n</var>th match to be replaced. It is an error
if no substitutions are performed on any of the addressed lines. The
current address is set to the last line affected.

     <p><var>re</var> and <var>replacement</var> may be delimited by any character other
than &lt;space&gt;, &lt;newline&gt; and the characters used by the form of
the '<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' command shown below. If one or two of the last delimiters
is omitted, then the last line affected is printed as if the print
suffix '<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' were specified.

     </p><p>An unescaped '<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>' in <var>replacement</var> is replaced by the currently
matched text. The character sequence '<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>m</var></samp>' where <var>m</var> is a
number in the range [1,9], is replaced by the <var>m</var>th backreference
expression of the matched text. If <var>replacement</var> consists of a
single '<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>', then <var>replacement</var> from the last substitution is
used. Newlines may be embedded in <var>replacement</var> if they are escaped
with a backslash ('<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>').

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>(.,.)s</code></dt><dd>Repeats the last substitution. This form of the '<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' command accepts
a count suffix <var>n</var>, and any combination of the characters '<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>',
'<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>', and '<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>'. If a count suffix <var>n</var> is given, then only
the <var>n</var>th match is replaced. The '<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>' suffix causes the regular
expression of the last search to be used instead of the that of the last
substitution. The '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' suffix toggles the global suffix of the last
substitution. The '<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' suffix toggles the print suffix of the last
substitution. The current address is set to the last line affected.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)t(.)</code></dt><dd>Copies (i.e., transfers) the addressed lines to after the right-hand
destination address, which may be the address '<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' (zero). The
current address is set to the last line copied.

     <br></dd><dt><code>u</code></dt><dd>Undoes the last command and restores the current address to what it was
before the command. The global commands '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>',
and '<samp><span class="samp">V</span></samp>' are treated as a single command by undo. '<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>' is its
own inverse.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(1,$)v/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code><var>command-list</var></dt><dd>This is similar to the '<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' command except that it applies
<var>command-list</var> to each of the addressed lines not matching the
regular expression <var>re</var>.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(1,$)V/</code><var>re</var><code>/</code></dt><dd>This is similar to the '<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>' command except that it interactively
edits the addressed lines not matching the regular expression <var>re</var>.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(1,$)w </code><var>file</var></dt><dd>Writes the addressed lines to <var>file</var>. Any previous contents of
<var>file</var> is lost without warning. If there is no default filename,
then the default filename is set to <var>file</var>, otherwise it is
unchanged. If no filename is specified, then the default filename is
used. The current address is unchanged.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(1,$)w !</code><var>command</var></dt><dd>Writes the addressed lines to the standard input of
'<samp><span class="samp">!</span><var>command</var></samp>', (see the '<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' command below). The default
filename and current address are unchanged.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(1,$)wq </code><var>file</var></dt><dd>Writes the addressed lines to <var>file</var>, and then executes a '<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>'
command.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(1,$)W </code><var>file</var></dt><dd>Appends the addressed lines to the end of <var>file</var>. This is similar to
the '<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>' command, expect that the previous contents of file is not
clobbered. The current address is unchanged.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.)x</code></dt><dd>Copies (puts) the contents of the cut buffer to after the addressed
line. The current address is set to the last line copied.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.,.)y</code></dt><dd>Copies (yanks) the addressed lines to the cut buffer. The cut buffer is
overwritten by subsequent '<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>', '<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>', or
'<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>' commands. The current address is unchanged.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(.+1)z</code><var>n</var></dt><dd>Scrolls <var>n</var> lines at a time starting at addressed line, and sets
window size to <var>n</var>. If <var>n</var> is not specified, then the current
window size is used. Window size defaults to screen size minus two

<h2 class="chapter">7 Limitations</h2>

<p>If the terminal hangs up, <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> attempts to write the buffer to
the file <samp><span class="file">ed.hup</span></samp> or, if this fails, to <samp><span class="file">$HOME/ed.hup</span></samp>.

   </p><p><samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> processes <var>file</var> arguments for backslash escapes, i.e.,
in a filename, any character preceded by a backslash ('<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>') is
interpreted literally.

   </p><p>If a text (non-binary) file is not terminated by a newline character,
then <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> appends one on reading/writing it. In the case of a
binary file, <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> does not append a newline on reading/writing.

   </p><p>Per line overhead: 2 <code>pointer</code>s, 1 <code>long int</code>, and 1 <code>int</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Diagnostics</h2>

<p>When an error occurs, if <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp>'s input is from a regular file or
here document, then it exits, otherwise it prints a '<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' and returns
to command mode. An explanation of the last error can be printed with
the '<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>' (help) command.

   </p><p>If the '<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>' (undo) command occurs in a global command list, then the
command list is executed only once.

   </p><p>Attempting to quit <samp><span class="command">ed</span></samp> or edit another file before writing a
modified buffer results in an error. If the command is entered a second
time, it succeeds, but any changes to the buffer are lost.

<pre class="display">     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type="1" start="0">
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p><p>This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p><p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p></li><li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &#8220;Document&#8221;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p><p>A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p><p>A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p><p>The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p><p>The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p><p>A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.

     </p><p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p><p>The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p><p>The &#8220;publisher&#8221; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p><p>A section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
&#8220;Dedications&#8221;, &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;.)  To &#8220;Preserve the Title&#8221;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; according to this definition.

     </p><p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p></li><li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p><p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p></li><li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p><p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p><p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p><p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p></li><li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p><ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li><li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li><li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li><li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li><li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li><li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li><li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li><li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li><li>Preserve the section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li><li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &#8220;History&#8221; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li><li>For any section Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221; or &#8220;Dedications&#8221;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li><li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li><li>Delete any section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li><li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li><li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li></ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p><p>You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p></li><li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p><p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p><p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&#8220;History&#8221;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
and any sections Entitled &#8220;Dedications&#8221;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &#8220;Endorsements.&#8221;

     </p></li><li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p><p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p></li><li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p><p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p></li><li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p><p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
&#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p></li><li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p><p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p><p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p><p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p></li><li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p></li><li>RELICENSING

     <p>&#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&#8221; (or &#8220;MMC Site&#8221;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&#8220;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&#8221; (or &#8220;MMC&#8221;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p><p>&#8220;CC-BY-SA&#8221; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p><p>&#8220;Incorporate&#8221; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p><p>An MMC is &#8220;eligible for relicensing&#8221; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
